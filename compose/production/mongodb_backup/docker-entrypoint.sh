# When Bash receives a signal for which a trap has been set while waiting for a
# command to complete, the trap will not be executed until the command
# completes. When Bash is waiting for an asynchronous command via the wait
# built-in, the reception of a signal for which a trap has been set will cause
# the wait built-in to return immediately with an exit status greater than 128,
# immediately after which the trap is executed.
